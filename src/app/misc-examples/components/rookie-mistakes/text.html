<h3>Mistake #4:  Using ngOnChanges to detect query list changes</h3>
<h4>click the "Add item" button</h4>
<pre>
 In Angular 1, if you wanted to be notified when a value changed, you'd have to set a
    $scope.$watch and manually check for changes each digest cycle.   In Angular 2, the
    ngOnChanges hook greatly simplifies this process. Once you define an ngOnChanges method
    in your component class, it will be called whenever the component's inputs change.
    This comes in very handy.

 However, the ngOnChanges method executes only when the component's inputs change -- specifically,
    those items you have included in your inputs array or explicitly labeled with an @Input decorator.
    It will not be called when items are added or removed from @ViewChildren or @ContentChildren  query lists.

 If you want to be notified of changes in a query list, don't use ngOnChanges.  Instead subscribe
    to the query list's built-in observable, its "changes" property.  As long as you do so in the
    proper lifecycle hook, not the constructor, you will be notified whenever an item is added or removed.
