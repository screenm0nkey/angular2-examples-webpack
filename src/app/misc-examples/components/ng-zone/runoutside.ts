    <p>NgZone comes with an API runOutsideAngular() <highlight>which performs a
      given task outside NgZoneâ€™s parent zone. This means it does not emit an 'onTurnDone'
      event, hence no change detection is performed.</highlight> This means it will be faster.</p>

    <p>ngDoCheck() is called every time the component is checked.
      a component is checked every time change detection occurs, which is triggered
      every time an angular event happens i.e click, settimeout, http etc.</p>

    <p>Running processes outside of the Angular zone stops ngDoCheck() being called.</p>

    <p>Progress: {{progress}}%</p>
    <p *ngIf='progress >= 100'>Done processing {{label}} of Angular zone!</p>

    <button (click)='processWithinAngularZone()'>Process within Angular zone</button>
    <button (click)='processOutsideOfAngularZone()'>Process outside of Angular zone</button>
