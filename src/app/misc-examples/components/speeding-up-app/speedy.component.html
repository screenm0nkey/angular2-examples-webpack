  <h4>How to Speed Up an Application</h4>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush - Use Angular’s OnPush change detection strategy to save view bindings being
      checked per change
      detection task. This can only be used on components which have a <code>@inputs</code>.
    </li>
    <li>“Simple” NgFor - Angular’s NgFor directive is sometimes a little bit too smart. A simpler version of it could be
      faster
    </li>
    <li>Detach change detectors - Another option is to detach all change detectors from the tree and only perform change
      detection for the components that is actually changing
    </li>
    <li>Avoid using the ngZone using runOutsideAngular()</li>
  </ul>
