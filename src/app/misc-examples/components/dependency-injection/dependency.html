    <h4>Main bullet points for dependency injection</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Every component comes with its own injector</li>

      <li>Providers are flattened, meaning that, if there are multiple providers with the same token, the
        last one wins. Use <code>InjectionToken</code> to avoid overwriting provider.
      </li>

      <li>When using a string token we HAVE to use <code>@Inject</code>, i.e. <code>@Inject('whateverToken') public
        some3</code></li>

      <li>
        multi providers <code>multi: true</code> basically extend the thing that is being injected for a particular
        token.
        Angular uses this mechanism to provide pluggable hooks i.e extending <code>NG_VALIDATORS,
        HTTP_INTERCEPTORS</code>
      </li>

      <li>If we provide services in a module they will be globally available as all modules use the root
        injector. This is NOT the case with Lazy loaded modules, who get their own injector.
        See <a routerLink="../modules" routerLinkActive="active">Modules</a> for more info.
        This can be avoided and a singleton can be created if you <code>forRoot()</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        When a module is loaded at application launch, its providers (services) have application-wide scope. They are
        available for injection throughout the application, which is why you should try load the module lazily if you
        can.
        <highlight>Angular gives a lazy-loaded module its own child injector. The module's providers are visible only
          within
          the component tree created with this injector. If you must load the module eagerly, when the application
          starts,
          provide the service in a component instead i.e. <code>@Component(
            <cur>providers : [...</cur>
            )</code>
        </highlight>
        <dlink [id]="13"></dlink>
      </li>

      <li>If the injector doesn't have a provider for the requested token, it delegates
        the request to its parent injector, where the process repeats until there are
        no more injectors.
      </li>

      <li>A new injector has no providers. Each component has it's own injector or child-injector</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Using providedIn @Injectable(<cur>providedIn: 'root'</cur>)</h4>
    <dlink [id]="6"></dlink><br>
    <dlink [id]="61"></dlink>
    
    <p class="highlight">Stick with providedIn: ‘root’ in every eagerly imported module scenario. See <dlink [id]="61"></dlink></p>
    
    <p>There is now a new, recommended, way to register a provider, directly inside the <code>@Injectable()</code>
      decorator, using the new <code>providedIn</code> attribute. It accepts 'root' as a value or any module of your
      application.
      <highlight>When you use 'root', your injectable will be registered as a singleton in the application, and you
        don’t need
        to add it to the
        providers of the root module.</highlight> Similarly, if you use <code>providedIn: UsersModule</code>, the
      injectable is
      registered as
      a provider of the UsersModule without adding it to the providers of the module.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use providedIn: 'root' for services which should be available in whole application as singletons</li>
      <li>Use providedIn: LazyServiceModule to prevent service injection in the eagerly imported part of the
        application
      </li>
      <li>To prevent usage of a services outside of the desired module, use LazyServiceModule which will be imported
        by LazyModule to prevent circular dependency warning. LazyModule will then be lazy loaded using Angular Router
        for some route in a standard fashion
        <dlink [id]="6"></dlink>
        .
      </li>
      <li class="highlight">Use providers: [] inside of @Component or @Directive to scope service only for the
        particular
        component sub-tree which will also lead to creation of multiple service instances (one service instance per
        one component usage)
      </li>
      <li>Always try to scope your services conservatively to prevent dependency creep and resulting tangled hell</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Lazy loading & The providedIn: ‘root’ solution -->
  <section collapse-it class="well">
    <h4>Lazy loading & The <cur>providedIn:root</cur> solution</h4>
    <p>
      Essentially lazy loading could trigger
      certain bugs related to services overriding each other in the global context
      that are hard to reproduce due to accidental overwrites of injectables.
      In order to avoid this this, angular will create a child dependency injection context.
      This context will contain the service, but <highlight>this service will not be visible to the rest of the
        application.</highlight>
    </p>

    <p>What would happen if we used providedIn: 'root' to implement service which we want to use in lazy loaded
      module?</p>

    <p>Technically, <highlight>the 'root' stands for AppModule</highlight> but Angular is smart enough to bundle service
      in
      the lazy loaded
      bundle if it is only injected in the lazy components / services. But there is a catch.
      If we later additionally inject service which is meant to belong to lazy module in any eager part of the
      application it will be then automatically bundled in the main bundle.</p>

    <p>To summarize… <highlight>If the service is only injected in the lazy part, it will be bundled in lazy bundle
        If the service is injected in the eager part (while still possibly being injected in the lazy part), it will be
        bundled in the eager main bundle
        The problem with this behavior is that it can get quite unpredictable in the larger applications with tons of
        modules and hundreds of services.</highlight>

    <h4>Using <code>providers: []</code> property in a @NgModule can lead to four different scenarios based on specific
      circumstances…</h4>

    <h4>Eager @NgModule</h4>
    <p>In this case, service will be registered as a global singleton. Service will be provided as a singleton even if
      it is included in the providers:[] of multiple eager modules. Only one instance will be created by the injector
      and this is because they will all end up registered with the root level injector.</p>

    <h4>Lazy @NgModule</h4>
    <p>Instance of the service provided in the lazy module will be created on the child injector (of the lazy module)
      when initialized later during the application run-time. Injecting such a service into the eager part would lead
      to No provider for MyService! error.</p>

    <h4>Declarables — @Component or @Directive</h4>
    <p>Component providers are made available to the component and all its view AND content child components
      (i.e. components in its template but also projected components rendered by <code>ng-content</code>).</p>

    <h4>View providers</h4>
    <p>They are only made available for the component and its view child components. They are declared by the
      viewProviders option in the component decorator.</p>

    <div class="links">

    </div>
    <code>providers: [NewLoggerService,<cur> provide: LoggerService, useExisting: NewLoggerService</cur>]</code>
    <p><code>useExisting</code> is a bit different than the other provider strategies. It’s the only strategy that
      doesn’t actually
      create an instance, but instead, it points to another token which in turn will create the instance.</p>

  <!-- <h4>Hierarchy of Element, Component and Module Injectors</h4> -->

    <h4>Hierarchy of Element, Component and Module Injectors</h4>
    <p>Angular resolves dependencies in 3 stages starting with the hierarchy of element injectors and moving up to
      component injectors and then module injectors.</p>

    <p>The last two stages of the resolution process that goes upwards through module and component injectors.
      Angular creates a hierarchy of module injectors when you lazy load a module. The hierarchy of component
      injectors
      is created by nesting components in templates. Internally, <highlight>component injectors are also referred to as
        View
        Injectors</highlight>
    </p>
    <p>A hierarchy of element injectors, on the other hand, is a lesser-known feature of Angular’s DI system mostly
      because it’s not really documented anywhere. But exactly this kind of injectors is the first stage of the DI
      resolution process. And these injectors make up a hierarchy that is used to resolve dependencies decorated with
      the <code>@Host</code> decorator. </p>

    <h4>The DI in Angular 2 basically consists of three things:</h4>

        dependencies

      <li><span class="red">Provider</span> - A provider is a recipe for delivering a service associated with a
        token. It tells the injector how to create an
        instance of a dependency. A provider takes a token and maps that to a factory function that creates an object.
