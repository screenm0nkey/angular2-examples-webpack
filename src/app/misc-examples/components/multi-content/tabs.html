<h4>Tabs Example</h4>
<code>@ContentChildren(Tab) tabs: QueryList&lt;Tab&gt;</code>
<p>
  QueryList is a class provided by Angular and when we use QueryList with a @ContentChildren annotation
  Angular populates this with the components that match the query and then keeps the items
  up to date if the state of the application changes.
  However, QueryList requires a @ContentChildren to populate it, so letâ€™s take a look at that now.
</p>

<p>
  On the tabs instance variable, we add the <code>@ContentChildren(Tab)</code> annotation.
  This annotation will tell Angular to inject all the direct child directives (of the Tab type) into the tabs parameter.
  We then assign it to the tabs property of our component. With this we now have access to all the child Tab components.
