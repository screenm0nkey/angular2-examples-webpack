    <h4>Notes on How to Speed Up an Application</h4>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>
        To make zones faster it is possible to bypass zones entirely for
        performance focused applications. To bypass zones, bootstrap your
        application with ‘noop’ as your ngZone.
        <code
          >platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule,
          <cur>ngZone: 'noop'</cur>
          ).then( ref =>
          <cur></cur>
          );</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush</code> - Use Angular’s OnPush
        change detection strategy to save view bindings being checked per change
        detection task. This can only be used on components which have a
        <code>@inputs</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Simple” NgFor - Angular’s NgFor directive is sometimes a little bit too
        smart. A simpler version of it could be faster
      </li>
      <li>
        Detach change detectors - Another option is to detach all change
        detectors from the tree and only perform change detection for the
        components that is actually changing
      </li>
      <li>Avoid using the ngZone using runOutsideAngular()</li>

      Make an app faster by writing our own a simpleNgFor directive and using
      changeDetectorRef.detach()
    </h4>

    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing, we detach the component’s change detectors from the tree.
      We can inject a component’s ChangeDetectorRef using DI and use its
      <code>this.cdr.detach()</code> method for that. The only thing we need to
      keep in mind is that we only want to detach the change detectors after
      change detection has been performed for the first time, otherwise we won’t
      see any boxes. To call detach() in the right moment, we can take advantage
      of Angular’s <code>AfterViewInit</code> life cycle hook.

      <h4>Using Zones to speed up an Application</h4>

        Using Zones for better performance /p>

        <code>this.zone.runOutsideAngular()</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        So the reason it's faster outside of the NgZone is because when you add
        a handler to an event like "mousemove" it is actually using
        Zone.onmousemove, which triggers the change detection when the event
        occurs.
        <highlight
          >Binding the event handler outside of Zone stops the change detection
          being triggered.</highlight
        >
        If you look at the console you will only see the change detection
        happening a few times when it's outside.
      </p>

      <p class="highlight">
        One interesting point is that the change detection for a component won't
        be invoked unless it is using any of the monkey-patched events. i.e. if
        there if there are no event handlers used like
        <code>(mousedown)="mouseDown($event)"</code>
        then the <code>ngDoCheck()</code> will not be called.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Monkey-patched Hooks</span><br />
        For example, when we call setTimeout() we actually call
        Zone.setTimeout(), which in turn creates a new zone using zone.fork() in
        which the given handler is executed. And that’s why our hooks are
        executed as well, because the forked zone in which the handler will be
        executed, simply inherits from the parent zone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <highlight
          >Using Zones is a great way to escape Angular’s change detection,
          without detaching change detectors and making the application code too
          complex.</highlight
        >
        In fact, it turns out that Zones APIs are super easy to use, especially
        NgZone’s APIs to run code outside or inside Angular. Based on the
        numbers, we can even say that the NgZone example is about as fast as the
        fastest solution above it.
