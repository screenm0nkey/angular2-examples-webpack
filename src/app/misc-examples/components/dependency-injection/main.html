        Angular 2 how to isolate service provider in a feature module
      </a>
    </p>

    <p class="strong">Every component comes with its own injector</p>

    <p class="strong">Providers are flattened, meaning that, if there are multiple providers with the same token, the
      last one wins. Use Tokens to void this.</p>

    <p class="strong">When using a string token we HAVE to use @Inject, i.e. <code>@Inject('whateverToken') public
      some3</code></p>

    <p class="strong">
      multi providers basically extend the thing that is being injected for a particular token.
      Angular uses this mechanism to provide pluggable hooks i.e extending NG_VALIDATORS
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>If we provide services in a module they will be globally available as all modules use the root
        injector. This is NOT the case with Lazy loaded modules.</strong>
      Essentially lazy loading could trigger
      certain bugs related to services overriding each other in the global context
      that are hard to reproduce due to accidental overwrites of injectables.
      In order to avoid this this, angular will create a child dependency injection context.
      This context will contain the service, but this service will not be visible to the rest of the application.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>When a module is loaded at application launch, its @NgModule.providers have application-wide scope.
        They are available for injection throughout the application.</strong> Load the module lazily if you can.
      Angular gives a lazy-loaded module its own child injector. The module's providers are visible only
      within the component tree created with this injector. If you must load the module eagerly, when the
      application starts, provide the service in a component instead <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39828246/angular-2-how-to-isolate-service-provider-in-a-feature-module"
      target="_blank">Taken
      from here</a>
    </p>

    <ul>
      The DI in Angular 2 basically consists of three things:<br>
      <li><span class="red">Injector</span> - The injector object that exposes APIs to allow us to create instances of
        dependencies
      </li>
      <li><span class="red">Provider</span> - A provider is like a recipe that tells the injector how to create an
        instance of a dependency. A provider takes a token and maps that to a factory function that creates an object.
      <li><span class="red">Dependency</span> - A dependency is the type of which an object should be created.</li>
    </ul>

    <i>We get a service from a dependency injector by giving it a token.</i>

    <code>constructor(logger: LoggerService) &#123;
      logger.logInfo('Creating HeroBiosComponent');
      &#125;</code>

    <p>In the case above Angular asks the injector for the service associated
      with the token called "LoggerService" and assigns the returned value
      to the logger parameter.</p>

    <p class="strong">A provider is a recipe for delivering a service associated with a
      token.</p>

    <p>If the injector doesn't have a provider for the requested token, it delegates
      the request to its parent injector, where the process repeats until there are
      no more injectors.</p>

    <p>A new injector has no providers. Each component has it's own injector or child-injector.</p>

    <i>The simple "class" Provider is the most typical by far.</i>

    <code>&#123; provide: LoggerService, useClass: DateLoggerService &#125;</code>
    <p>The provide object literal above takes a token and a definition object. The token is usually a class but it
      doesn't have to be.</p>
    <p class="strong">The “LoggerService” is the token, the “DateLoggerService” is the Definition Object or Factory</p>


    <p><strong>Set the "useValue" property to a fixed value that the provider can return as the dependency
      object.</strong>
      Use this technique to provide runtime configuration constants such as web-site
      base addresses and feature flags. We often use a value provider in a unit test
      to replace a production service with a fake or mock.</p>

    <h4>Modules</h4>
    <a href="http://blog.angular-university.io/angular2-ngmodule/" class="block" target="_blank">
      Angular 2 NgModule Intro - Ahead Of Time Compilation And Lazy Loading - Avoid Common Pitfalls
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>we can list the components, directives, and pipes that are part of the module in the declarations array</li>
      <li>we can import other modules by listing them in the imports array</li>
      <li>we can export ....</li>
      <li>they are essential for template parsing, both in the Just In Time or Ahead Of Time Compilation scenarios as we
        will see
      </li>
      <li>They can be used to clarify which components and directives are meant to be used publicly vs internal
        implementation details, as we will soon see
      </li>
      <li> Angular module allows Angular to define a context for compiling templates. Each HTML tag is compared to that
        list to see if a component should be applied on top of it, the same goes for each attribute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each application only has one root module, and each component, directive and pipe should only be associated with
        a single module.
      </li>
      <li>When the module is lazy loaded, the providers don't become globally
        available, only within the scope of the lazy loaded module.
      </li>

      <li>
        When a module is loaded at application launch, its @NgModule.providers have application-wide scope.
        They are available for injection throughout the application. Load the module lazily if you can.
        <strong>Angular gives a lazy-loaded module its own child injector. The module's providers are visible only
          within the component tree created with this injector. If you must load the module eagerly, when the
          application starts, provide the service in a component instead.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Components are not visible outside of their modules unless the module exports the component</li>
      <li>
        Components can be exported without adding it to declarations. This would happen in the case where the component
        is not used internally inside the module.
      </li>
      <li>
        You cannot import a component directly. it has to be part of a module.
      </li>
      <li>Services loaded in modules are available globally Modules that are directly imported are usually meant to
        enrich the global application and the injectables received are in most of the cases meant as application-wide
        singletons.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each module needs to define separately what it can 'see' in its context, so the solution is to import the modules i.e CommonModule
      </li>
